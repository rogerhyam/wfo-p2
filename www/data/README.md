# Facet Data Directory

This directory and sub directories contains 'data' that is useful for diplaying facets/attributes
but that we don't want to store in the index at this stage.

The next level of directories is based on the facet id.

The contents of these directories is dependent on the facet but will usually use the 'code' field
of the facet value to name the files appropriately.

Initial use if for geo.json files for mapping.

Subsequent uses might be for icons for different attibutes - IUCN statuses etc.
